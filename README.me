# Tree-rs

Tree-rs tries to create a cross-platform alternative to the unix `tree` command.

It is currently only tested on linux, but it I hope it works on windows.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/sighol/tree-rs
cargo install
```

## Performance

From the small tests that I've run, it is about half the speed of `tree`.
